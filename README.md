# Photoproduction
To Study Jets via Photoproduction 

I have modified the main69.cc and have made the following changes:
1. The output Histograms are now stored in a root file named photoproduction.root*
2. main69.cc have been renamed as photoproduction.cc

*(ROOT libraries have been enabled and necessary modifications, check line have been done in the makefile)
